- Add support for Ook! input/output/translation? (including Ook!-to-Brainf*ck
  mapping information in the built-in help)
- Add a version history to the README
- When both an -e switch and a filename are given on the command line, execute
  both in the same "environment"?
- Make the data array automatically increase in size as needed (This should
  possibly only be in effect when a certain switch is specified so that
  programs that "loop around" the ends of the data array still work.)
- Make psych execute (and store) program code while reading it, not just after
  EOF is reached.  (However, code outside of any brackets should be discarded
  after being executed.)
- Add hexadecimal equivalents of the -d and -p switches
- Add a switch for setting an initial part of the array before execution
 - e.g., `psych -a 72,101,108,108,111`
 - Support hexadecimal and octal numbers, too

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 1.0.1
