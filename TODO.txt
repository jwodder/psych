- Add support for Ook! input/output/translation? (including Ook!-to-Brainf*ck
  mapping information in the built-in help)
- When both an -e switch and a filename are given on the command line, execute
  both in the same "environment"?
- Add a switch to make the data array automatically increase in size as needed
- Make psych execute (and store) program code while reading it, not just after
  EOF is reached.  (Code outside of any brackets should be discarded after
  being executed.)
- Add a switch for setting an initial part of the array before execution, e.g.,
  `psych -A 72,101,108,108,111`  (Support hexadecimal and octal numbers, too)
- Add a new command for dumping the contents of the data array around the
  pointer, with a command-line option for setting the radius of the dump
- Add in processing of switches in #! line?
- Add hexadecimal equivalents of the -d and -p switches?
- Should the output for the -p switch be comma-delimited?
